# Linkium

Linkium is a personal network management application.  
It helps you keep track of people you meet in your professional or personal life, store their details, and visualize how everyone is connected.

## What is Linkium?

Linkium lets you build your own personal network:
- Add and manage contacts with detailed information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, etc.).
- Organize and browse your network easily.
- Visualize connections between people in an interactive way (mind map planned).

## Why use Linkium?

We all meet people we donâ€™t want to forget: colleagues, collaborators, friends, or people from events.  
Linkium keeps them organized in one place, making it easier to remember whoâ€™s who and how youâ€™re connected.
